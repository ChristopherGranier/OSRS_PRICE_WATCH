# OSRS_PRICE_WATCH
-This project was created in my senior year of programming as a final project. I am currently still maintaining and adding to the code to improve the website in general and to improve my knowledge.

-This project is targeted at players who play the online MMORPG Runescape. This app allows them to monitor the Grand Exchange prices from anywhere.

-If the web application is hosted, simply navigate to osrspricewatch.azurewebsite.net and get started there. You can create an account and save favorites or just anonymously browse the items.

-If the web application is not hosted, clone the repo to your machine and launch it using Visual Studio. You will have to change the DB Connection strings and run the dotnet db update command to create the databases.
